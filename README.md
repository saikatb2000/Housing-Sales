## Key Insights

### 1. Price Analysis by Bedrooms
- **Trend Observation**: Properties with 5–6 bedrooms command the highest average prices, with peaks around 8 million. Properties with 0–4 bedrooms display more stable and lower pricing trends.
- **Outlier Detection**: A 33-bedroom property is priced significantly lower than expected, suggesting an anomaly that requires further analysis.

### 2. Seasonal Sales Patterns
- **Sales Peaks**: The highest sales activity is concentrated in May, followed by April and June. These months consistently outperform others in sales volume.
- **Slow Months**: Winter months, including January, February, November, and December, show a noticeable decline in sales activity.

### 3. Price vs. Square Footage Correlation
- **Linear Relationship**: A strong positive correlation exists between property price and square footage, with most properties clustering at lower square footage and price ranges.
- **Significant Outliers**: High-priced properties with up to 10,000 sqft are notable exceptions to the primary trend.

### 4. Geospatial Price Distribution
